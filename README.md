## Description

This web application provied a service that tells the user what types of food trucks might be found near a specific location on a map. The user can search the food by it's category (eg. Fruit) and name (eg. Peaches)

## Stack

This is a frontend progressive web application which is built on top of React.JS with Context API State Managment, Hooks, ES6+ syntax along with Materialize CSS as the UI and Mapbox Map Library. The application consumes the services of [DataSF's SODA API](https://datasf.org/). It is also a PWA with SEO principles. Generate the lighthouse report in the console menu to witness the score. 

## Tests

The tests are also written for components rendering and async ajax calls. Instead of mocking axios or fetch, I have used Mock Service Worker as recently suggested by Kent C Dodds - creator of React Testing Library and ton of other packages.
