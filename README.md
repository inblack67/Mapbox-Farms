## Description

This web application service that tells the user what types of food trucks might be found near a specific location on a map.

## Stack

This is a frontend progressive web application which is built on top of React.JS along with Materialize CSS as the UI and Mapbox Map Library. The application consumes the services of [DataSF's SODA API](https://datasf.org/). It is also a PWA with SEO principles. Generate the lighthouse report in the console menu to witness the score. 

## Tests

The tests are also written for components rendering and async ajax calls. Instead of mocking axios or fetch, I have used Mock Service Worker as recently suggested by Kent C Dodds - creator of React Testing Library and ton of other packages.

It's a fullstack javascript web application named BootCamps where you can explore the Bootcamps, review them or choose the best fit for you, by location, money, courses etc. Or, publish a new Bootcamp and manage it by adding courses, photo and what not. It's been deployed to heroku (backend) and Netlify (frontend). [Explore](https://bootcamps.netlify.app/)
